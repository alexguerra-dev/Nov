## Rules

Each **player** takes **turns** rolling dice.

A player rolls dice to gain points on there turn. A turn is one or more rolls.

If a player ever rolls **no** scoring dice sets the players’ turn is over and they get **no** points for that round.

A player may choose to stop after a roll with a **new** scoring dice set and keep the points adding them to the player's total score. The only time a player is forced to roll is when all dice are scoring sets.

### Scoring Dice Combinations

- Single
  - 1 = 100
  - 5 = 50
- Triple or “Three of a kind””
  - 1 = 1000
  - 2 = 200
  - 3 = 300
  - 4 = 400
  - 5 = 500
  - 6 = 600
  -
- Run or “Straight
  - 1,2,3,4,5” = 1500
  - 2,3,4,5,6 = 1500
- "Five Ones"
  - 5x1 = 5000

If at any point **all** of the dice are scoring **sets** the player rolls **all** five dice. (It is possible to roll no scoring dice when you are foced to roll, all points are lost)

The first player to reach 5,000 **ends** the game. When the game ends all other players have one last turn to beat the players score that ended the game.\*\*
